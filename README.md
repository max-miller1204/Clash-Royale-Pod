# Clash Royale Post-Game Analyzer

A computer vision and statistical modeling pipeline that analyzes Clash Royale match replays to evaluate decision-making, calculate expected value (EV) of card plays, and detect suboptimal moves.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension

### Setup

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Clash-Royale-Pod
   ```
2. Open in VS Code
   ```bash
   code .
   ```
3. When prompted, click **"Reopen in Container"** (or run `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container` from the command palette)
4. **Windows users:** If the container build fails with `\r': command not found` errors, your git converted files to Windows line endings. Fix it by running this **outside** the container before reopening:
   ```bash
   git pull
   git rm --cached -r .
   git reset --hard
   ```
5. Wait for the container to build (~3-5 min the first time)
5. Verify everything works:
   ```bash
   uv run python -c "import torch; import cv2; import ultralytics; print('ready')"
   ```

That's it. Python, PyTorch, YOLO, OpenCV, FFmpeg, Tesseract, and all dependencies are pre-installed.

| `make lint` | Run ruff linter |
| `make format` | Auto-format code with ruff |
| `make type-check` | Run mypy type checker |

## Git Workflow

We use the **Fork + Pull Request** workflow. No one pushes directly to the main repo — all changes go through PRs that are reviewed and merged by the maintainer (@max).

### First-time setup (do this once)

1. **Fork** the repo — click the **Fork** button on GitHub to create a copy under your own account.
2. **Clone your fork** (not the main repo):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Clash-Royale-Pod.git
   cd Clash-Royale-Pod
   ```
3. **Add the main repo as a remote** so you can pull updates:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/<main-repo-owner>/Clash-Royale-Pod.git
   ```
4. Open in VS Code and reopen in the dev container (see [Quick Start](#quick-start)).

### Already cloned the main repo?

If you cloned the main repo before creating your fork, you don't need to start over. Just fork on GitHub, then swap your remotes:

```bash
# Rename origin (currently the main repo) to upstream
git remote rename origin upstream

# Add your fork as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/Clash-Royale-Pod.git

# Verify — origin should be your fork, upstream should be the main repo
git remote -v
```

### The workflow for every task

1. **Sync your fork** with the latest main before starting new work:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   git push origin main
   ```
2. **Create a branch** for your specific task:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b data/add-annotation-script
   ```
3. **Do your work and commit** with descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git add <files>
   git commit -m "data: add annotation script for tower labels"
   ```
4. **Push to your fork:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin data/add-annotation-script
   ```
5. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub from your fork's branch to the main repo's `main` branch.
6. **Review & merge** — automated checks run, the maintainer reviews the code, and once approved it gets merged.

### Updating an open PR

When the maintainer reviews your PR and requests changes, you don't need to open a new PR. Just push more commits to the same branch — the PR updates automatically:

```bash
# You're still on your branch
git checkout data/add-annotation-script

# Make the requested fixes
git add <files>
git commit -m "data: fix edge case in annotation parser"

# Push to the same branch — the PR updates automatically
git push origin data/add-annotation-script
```

### Branch naming

Use a prefix matching your sub-team:
- `data/*` — Data & Detection
- `tracking/*` — Tracking & Feature Engineering
- `modeling/*` — Modeling & Visualization
- `docs/*` — Documentation

### Keep branches short-lived

A branch should be created for a specific task, worked on for a few days, PR'd, merged, and then deleted. Don't let branches sit for weeks — the longer a branch lives, the more `main` changes underneath it, and the more likely you are to hit merge conflicts. Finish the task, open the PR, get it merged, move on.

### Handling merge conflicts

Conflicts happen when two people edit the same lines in the same file. If your PR shows a conflict:

```bash
# Update your local main from the main repo
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Merge main into your branch
git checkout data/my-branch
git merge main
```

Git will mark conflicts in the file. Open it, pick the correct version, remove the `<<<<<<<` / `=======` / `>>>>>>>` markers, then:

```bash
git add <conflicted-file>
git commit -m "data: resolve merge conflict"
git push
```

**To minimize conflicts:** sync your fork often, keep branches short-lived, and try to split work by file when possible (if you own `annotate.py` and your teammate owns `train.py`, you'll almost never conflict).

## Project Management

### Branch protection

The `main` branch is protected. No one can push to it directly — all changes must go through a Pull Request and be approved by the maintainer.

### Issue tracker

Use GitHub Issues to report bugs, propose features, and organize tasks. Reference issues in your commits and PRs (e.g., `fixes #12`).

### Maintainer

@max holds merge privileges and reviews all PRs. If your PR is ready for review, request a review from @max on GitHub.

## Managing Dependencies Across the Team

Since we use **uv + `pyproject.toml`**, adding packages on feature branches merges cleanly:

1. **Add a package** on your branch: `uv add <package>` — this updates `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.
2. **Include both files** in your PR commit.
3. **On merge**, Git auto-merges `pyproject.toml` as long as different people edited different lines. If there's a conflict in `uv.lock`, resolve `pyproject.toml` first, then run `uv lock` to regenerate the lockfile.

### After pulling main with new dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

This installs any newly added packages in your existing container. **No container rebuild needed.**

### When a container rebuild IS needed

Rebuild your container (VS Code: `Dev Containers: Rebuild Container`) if a PR changed:
- `Dockerfile` (e.g., new system package like a C library)
- `devcontainer.json` (features or settings)
- `docker-compose.yml`
